# ARG-HMRG-Colocalization-Analyzer

A comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to identify and analyze the co-localization of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) and Heavy Metal Resistance Genes (HMRGs) in metagenomic data.

This workflow takes assembled contigs as input and produces statistical reports, abundance tables, and formatted data ready for gene cluster visualization. The pipeline is structured as a series of modular Bash and Python scripts, ensuring reproducibility and flexibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Software
*   [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) for gene prediction.
*   [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) for protein sequence alignment.
*   A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows) with Bash.
*   [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with the following library:
    *   `pandas`

### Databases
*   **CARD**: The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database.
*   **BacMet**: A database of antibacterial biocide and metal resistance genes.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

It is recommended to run the scripts in sequential order as they depend on the output of the previous steps.

### Initial Setup

1.  Place your assembled contig files (e.g., `A1A_contigs.fasta`, `A1B_contigs.fasta`) into an `input_data/` directory.
2.  Run the database preparation script (`08`) once to download and format the necessary databases.

### Script Workflow

**07. `07_create_prodigal_script.sh`**
*   **Purpose**: Predicts protein-coding genes from contigs using Prodigal.
*   **Action**: Generates and executes a script to run Prodigal in parallel for all samples defined in the `SAMPLES` array.
*   **Output**: Predicted proteins (`.faa`), genes (`.fna`), and coordinates (`.gff`) in the `analysis_results/` directory.

**08. `08_create_database_script.sh`** (Run once)
*   **Purpose**: Downloads and formats the CARD and BacMet databases.
*   **Action**: Generates and executes a script to download, combine (for BacMet), and build DIAMOND databases.
*   **Output**: DIAMOND database files (`.dmnd`) in a `~/databases/` directory.

**09. `09_create_arg_annotation_script.sh`**
*   **Purpose**: Annotates predicted proteins against the CARD database to find ARGs.
*   **Action**: Generates and executes a script to run DIAMOND for all samples.
*   **Output**: ARG hit tables (`_card_hits.m8`) in `analysis_results/`.

**10. `10_create_bacmet_annotation_script.sh`**
*   **Purpose**: Annotates predicted proteins against the combined BacMet database to find HMRGs.
*   **Action**: Generates and executes a script to run DIAMOND for all samples.
*   **Output**: HMRG hit tables (`_bacmet_hits.tsv`) in `analysis_results/`.

**10.5. `10.5_create_hmrg_annotation_map.py`** (Run once after database creation)
*   **Purpose**: **Crucial data standardization step.** Creates a "translation map" to resolve inconsistent HMRG naming in the BacMet database.
*   **Action**: Intelligently parses the complex BacMet FASTA headers to link protein accession numbers to their correct biological gene names.
*   **Output**: A master annotation file (`bacmet_annotation_map.tsv`) used by all subsequent scripts.

**11. `11_run_colocalization_analysis_v6.py`**
*   **Purpose**: The core analysis step. Integrates gene coordinates (GFF) with ARG and **standardized** HMRG annotations.
*   **Action**: Utilizes the map from script #10.5 to translate HMRG accession numbers into accurate gene names, then identifies co-localized contigs and generates a fully annotated report.
*   **Output**: Detailed and fully annotated reports (`_colocalization_full_details_annotated.tsv`) in a `colocalization_analysis_final/` directory.

**12. `12_analyze_abundance_v3.py`**
*   **Purpose**: Performs quantitative analysis on the integrated data.
*   **Action**: Has two functions: (1) Calculates the abundance of each unique "ARG-HMRG" pair based on shared contigs. (2) Independently calculates the total abundance of each individual HMRG within a sample.
*   **Output**: Gene pair abundance reports in `abundance_analysis_pairs/` and individual HMRG abundance reports in `abundance_analysis_hmrg/`.

**13. `13_prepare_cluster_data_v4.py`**
*   **Purpose**: Prepares the **complete** co-localization data for advanced visualization, with data cleaning.
*   **Action**: Formats the detailed report from script #11 and performs a **smart de-duplication**, merging genes with dual ARG/HMRG annotations into a single record.
*   **Output**: Formatted, de-duplicated data (`_plot_data.tsv`) in a `cluster_plotting_data_final/` directory.

**14. `14_filter_top_clusters-v3.py`**
*   **Purpose**: Filters the dataset to focus on the most significant co-localization events.
*   **Action**: Calculates a "co-localization density score" for each contig and selects the Top N (e.g., Top 10) highest-scoring contigs. Also includes the smart de-duplication step to ensure the final data is clean.
*   **Output**: A smaller, focused dataset (`_top_10_contigs_plot_data.tsv`) in a `top_10_contigs_for_plotting/` directory.

**15. `15_format_for_external_plotter.py`**
*   **Purpose**: Formats the filtered, high-density data into a generic format for external visualization websites or software.
*   **Action**: Converts the output from script #14 into the strict five-column format required by many plotters, renaming contig IDs to generic group names (Contig_1, Contig_2, etc.).
*   **Output**: The final, ready-to-upload data (`_final_plot_data.tsv`) in a `final_data_for_visualization/` directory.
